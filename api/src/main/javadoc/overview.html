The Java API for JSON Processing provides interfaces and classes to parse,
generate, transform, and query <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> using the
streaming model or the object model.

<p>The streaming model uses an event-based parser that reads JSON data in a
streaming way. The parser generates events and pauses for processing when it finds
one of the following: the beginning or the end of an object or an array, a key, 
or a value. Application code can process or discard the element referenced by a 
parser event, then the parser proceeds to the next event. The streaming model
is adequate for local processing where the processing of an element does not 
require information from other parts of the data. The streaming model writes 
JSON output to a given stream one value at a time.

<p>The object model creates a tree that represents the JSON data in memory. 
The tree can then be navigated and analyzed. This programming model is the 
most flexible and enables processing that requires access to the complete 
contents of the tree. However, it is often slower than the streaming model and 
requires more memory. The object model generates JSON output by navigating 
the entire tree at once. 

<h2>The Streaming API</h2>
<p>The streaming API is similar to the StAX API for XML and consists of the 
interfaces {@link javax.json.stream.JsonParser} and 
{@link javax.json.stream.JsonGenerator}. {@code JsonParser} 
contains methods to parse JSON data using the streaming model. 
{@code JsonGenerator} contains methods to write JSON data to an ouptut source.

<p>{@code JsonParser} provides forward, read-only access to 
JSON data using the pull parsing programming model. In this model the 
application code controls the thread and calls methods in the parser interface 
to move the parser forward or to obtain JSON data from the current state of 
the parser. Refer to 
<a href="javax/json/stream/JsonParser.html#JsonParserExample2">this example</a> 
for more details. 

<p>{@code JsonGenerator} provides methods to write JSON to a stream. The 
generator writes key-value pairs in JSON objects and values in JSON arrays. 
Refer to 
<a href="javax/json/stream/JsonGenerator.html#JsonGeneratorExample3">this 
example</a> for more details. 

<p>The streaming API is a low-level API designed to process large amounts of 
JSON data efficiently. Other JSON frameworks (such as JSON binding) can be 
implemented using this API.</p> 

<h2>The Object Model API</h2>
<p>The object model API is similar to the DOM API for XML. It is a high-level 
API that provides immutable object models for JSON object and array structures. 
These JSON structures are represented as object models using the Java types 
{@link javax.json.JsonObject} and {@link javax.json.JsonArray}. 
{@code JsonObject} provides a {@link java.util.Map} view to access the unordered 
collection of zero or more name/value pairs from the model. Similarly,
{@code JsonArray} provides a {@link java.util.List} view to access the ordered 
sequence of zero or more values from the model. 

<p>The object model API uses builder patterns to create these object models. 
Application code can use the class {@link javax.json.JsonObjectBuilder}
to create models that represent JSON objects. The resulting model is of type 
{@code JsonObject}. Refer to 
<a href="javax/json/JsonObjectBuilder.html#JsonObjectBuilderExample1">this example</a> 
for more details. Application code can use the class 
{@link javax.json.JsonArrayBuilder} to create models that represent JSON arrays. 
The resulting model is of type {@code JsonArray}. Refer to 
<a href="javax/json/JsonArrayBuilder.html#JsonArrayBuilderExample1">this example</a> 
for more details. 

<p>These object models can also be created from an input source (such as 
{@link java.io.InputStream} or {@link java.io.Reader}) using the class 
{@link javax.json.JsonReader}. 
<a href="javax/json/JsonReader.html#JsonReaderExample1">This example</a> shows 
how to read and create an empty {@code JsonArray} model using the class 
{@code JsonReader}. Similarly, these object models can be written to an output 
source (such as {@link java.io.OutputStream} or {@link java.io.Writer}) using 
the class {@link javax.json.JsonWriter}. 
<a href="javax/json/JsonWriter.html#JsonWriterExample1">This example</a> shows 
how to write an empty {@code JsonObject} model using the class 
{@code JsonWriter}.
