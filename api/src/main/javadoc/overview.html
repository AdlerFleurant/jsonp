Java API for JSON Processing provides a way to process <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a>. 

<p>This API defines streaming and object model API to process JSON. It can be used to:
<ul>
<li>Parse and generate JSON text in a streaming fashion
(similar to StAX API for XML).</li>
<li>Build a Java object model (similar to DOM API for XML) for JSON text. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Streaming API</h2>
<p>The streaming API is built upon {@link javax.json.stream.JsonParser} and {@link javax.json.stream.JsonGenerator} abstractions. A JsonParser can be used to parse JSON in a streaming way and a JsonGenerator can be used to generate JSON from scratch in a streaming way. It is a low-level API to process JSON and provides an efficient way to do the processing.

<h2>Object Model API</h2>
<p>The object model API is a high-level API that provides immutable object models for JSON object and array structures. These JSON structures are represented using {@link javax.json.JsonObject} and {@link javax.json.JsonArray} object models. JsonObject provides {@link java.util.Map} view to access its unordered collection of zero or more name/value pairs. Similarly, JsonArray provides {@link java.util.List} view to access its ordered sequence of zero or more values.

<p>The API uses builder patterns to build these object models of JSON from scratch. A {@link javax.json.JsonObjectBuilder} and {@link javax.json.JsonArrayBuilder} are used to build JsonObject and JsonArray structures respectively.

<p>These object models can also be created from an input source using a {@link javax.json.JsonReader}. Similarly, these object models can be written to an output source using a {@link javax.json.JsonWriter}.
